# Private Renewable Energy Market

A revolutionary blockchain-based platform that enables confidential trading of clean energy through Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. This platform creates a secure, private marketplace where energy producers and consumers can trade renewable energy without revealing sensitive business information.

## 🌱 Core Concept

### FHE-Powered Confidential Energy Trading

Our platform leverages **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to create the world's first truly private renewable energy marketplace. Unlike traditional energy trading platforms, all sensitive data including trade volumes, pricing, and participant identities remain encrypted throughout the entire trading process.

### Key Features

- **🔐 Complete Privacy**: All trading data is encrypted using FHE, ensuring trade secrets remain confidential
- **⚡ Multi-Energy Support**: Trade various renewable energy types (Solar, Wind, Hydro, Geothermal)
- **🌍 Carbon Credit Integration**: Automatic carbon credit calculation and distribution based on energy type
- **⏰ Time-Based Trading Periods**: Structured trading sessions with settlement phases
- **📊 Encrypted Market Statistics**: View market activity without compromising individual privacy
- **🏛️ Decentralized Governance**: Owner-controlled trading periods and market management

- Secure cost management strategies

## 🌟 How It Works

### 1. Energy Offer Submission
Renewable energy producers submit encrypted offers specifying:
- Energy amount (kWh)
- Price per kWh
- Energy type (Solar/Wind/Hydro/Geothermal)

### 2. Energy Demand Submission
Energy consumers submit encrypted demand requests with:
- Required energy amount
- Maximum acceptable price
- Quality preferences

### 3. Private Matching Algorithm
The FHE-powered smart contract:
- Matches supply and demand privately
- Calculates optimal pricing
- Executes trades automatically
- Maintains complete confidentiality

### 4. Carbon Credit Distribution
Based on energy type and trade volume:
- Solar: High carbon credit multiplier
- Wind: Medium-high carbon credit multiplier
- Hydro: Medium carbon credit multiplier
- Geothermal: Standard carbon credit multiplier
